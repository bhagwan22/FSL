AGENTS CREATE WO FROM "WORK TYPE TEMPLATES" ---> DISPATCHER assign WO to service appointments and resources. 			  
====================
Bsically FSL is the salesforce sweet help you to manage and enhance your business visibility and customer reach.

(#) FSL improves your business productivity ---- SPECIALLY!!! for business employe mobile workers or contractors!
 for example: TELECOMMUNICATION, RETAIL, CHILD CHARE, VANDING MACHINE SERVICE, WASTE MANAGEMENT, FINANCIAL SERVICE and many more.
 
 
 and if you look into  the wider picture each indusry have ther mobile workers which requires a lot of work to make thing go perfectly. 
 LETS try to understand this by taking an exmple of TV MACHENIC
 ========
 
		whole process include :  administrators, agents, dispatchers, and mobile workers(Technician) and people who make service calls. Each one has there specific job 
 
 So, managing!! & verifying!!  work is UPTO THE MARK is a little tedious job!!!  Don't you think?
 But thanks to salesforce FSL
 that manages and automate-- APPOINTMENTS, Dispatching mobile workers, equipments, stock,Progress status and tracking vehicle location. So you can provide a better customer experience!! and better relation.
 More importently  IT CAN BE SETUPed according to the ORGANISATION need.
 ============
 NOW LET'S see the objects and the steps that are used to track the progress.
 FIRST
 Administrator : Sets up field service features ---- includes installing the Field Service Lightning managed package and Field Service Lightning mobile app.
 
	THEN
 (1) Agents create work orders as customer service calls come in.
 (2) The dispatcher schedules appointments, optimizing them according to who has the right skills, is carrying the right parts, who is in the right location and accordingly notify them.
 (3) The mobile resources (or technicians) complete the service appointments and close out the work orders.

 3 IMP FEATURE OF FIELD SERVICE Lightning
 -----------------------------------------
 (#) SALEFORCE Core Field Service Lightning features
 (#) Scheduling and optimization from a managed package
 (#) A mobile app for your mobile workforce
 
 ======

So TO START WORKING WITH FSL... what we need is ....standard field service features & “Field Service" Standard user permission. :) which we already have 
But
we also need special permission set licenses(from field service manage packege) to view the dispatcher console, use the mobile app WHICH WE will SEE LITTLE LATER.


NOW let's get familier with some of the useful objects and standard FLS feature that salesforce provides.
Service resources
Service Crews
Work Order  :  request for field service work
Work Appiontments
Work Type
Skills
Product Required
Product consumed
Product Items
Product Transfer
Service resources
operating hours
Time Sheet
Return Order
Service report Templates
AND
auto generated WO from MAINTENANCE PLAIN




ALSO
fully functional FSL enables GeoCoding which mean tracking of mobile workforce and products stock became very simple.
FSL comes with a MANGED PACKAGE Link ...
which provides a customizable schedule, real-time map, and dispatcher console so you can get the right tech to the right job at the right time and more importently on there phone and even without internet. :D

IN GENERAL FSL CAN BE CATEGORISED IN THREE WAYS
(#) 1. CORE FSL features : for plan, perform track all of FSL work---- from wo, to installing, repair, maintainace and even performance reporting
(#) 2. FSL manged package: for dispatcher --- Optimize schedule and availability give access to overall view of progress, chart and map
(#) 3. FSL Mobile app :  for MOBILE WORKFORCE -- view appointments, get access to useful information anytime from anywhere -- WO, Contact detail, address. Also able to create follow up task and logs, Chatt with other Technician and Knowledge articles to stay up to date with the best solution.
and more importantly "Field Service Lightning" mobile app is available for free on the App Store and Google Play.  :D

					@@@@@ STEPS @@@@
				 <<<<=================>>>
				 
	### Step1: Quick find ---- > field service setting ---> enable field service lightning
	    ======
		  THEN
		Setup your FSL
			LIKE
			  (@#) enable notification for Workforce by  ----> Enable notifications
			  (@#) Under Auto-Created Service Appointments, set the Days After Created Date to 3.----> This means the due date on auto-created appointments is three days after the created date.
			  (@#) Sepecify which KNOWLEDGE articles to suggest  to workforce based on which field (MAX field to conside 5 and Min is 1)
			  
	(### Step2: 	
		`  =======
				CREATE/UPDATE USER to Available as "SERVICE RESOURCE" --->
					CHECK:  "Knowledge user"
					CHECK:  "Service Cloud User"
					Select TimeZone:  Eastern Time (America/New_York)
					
				SAVE
			[[[[ NOTE: now we can assign USER as a service resource. SERVICE RESOURCE:- Person Which bring service to the customers. ]]]
			
	(### step3:  CRETAE/ASSIG A SERVICE RESOURCE
	============
				(***)APP LAUNCHER ---> "Service resource"---> create one by 
															 NAME
															 USER(lookup)
															 Resource type (TECHNICIAN, DISPATCHER, CREW, AGENT etc )
															 and ACTIVE
															
															save
															
															
	(### step4:	 SET TERETORY AND WORKING HOUR OF SERVICE Resource
	============
					service territories help you track your field service work, help you set terms in service aggrement and working hours.
					Because no technician wanted to drove it's car 40-50 mile at 3:00AM ...M I Correct> Yaaass!!!  Because Everyone  prefer to work in a location near to there home, and at there availability:D 
					
					there for Once we have created oure service resources it is very necessory to set there "OPERATING HOURS" according to company operating time zone. 
					 (***) So "Field Service Lightning" can optimize your ---->> service appointments,
																				considering your service agreements, 	
																				employee schedules, and regional holidays
																				i.e let you take care of your workforce too
									
					step:
					=====
					
						App Launcher --> "Operating hours" ---> NEW (select your Time zone)
				===============		
				Similarly !! 
				
					(***) "Manage Service Territories"  -------> "Service Territories: ------>>> enter NAME, OPERATING HOURS(lookup), Active[{ imp to add members to this Territory 
																																				  and associate it with WO/appointments }]
				
				Basicly Service territories represent geographical area where your field service team works.
				Service territories help you organize your workforce. They typically represent geographical areas where your teams work, such as Los Angeles. They can also be functional territories, such as field sales and field service. So, for example, you may assign a technician with a home base of Los Angeles to the Los Angeles territory.
				
	(####  Also a technician can work in more than one territory. so  we can’t assign the operating hours directly on the service resource detail page.  
	SERVICE RESOURCE- (MAIN/PARENT OBJECT) 
	===========================
	
									Service Resource RELATED LIST:
									_______________________________
									-------------------------------
									(#) Service Resource History
									(#) Service Appointments
									(#) Service Appointments History
									(#) Skills

		APP Launcher --------->  SERVICE RESOURCE--------->  RELATED lIST  ServiceTerritory ------------>>  create service territory member(Lookup)  
		
		NOTE: SERVICE TERRITORY MEMBERS IS THE "JUNCTION OBJECT" between --- SERVICE RESOURCE and "SERVICE TERRITORY"
			
			
	 "Operating hours" and "mobile workers are assigned to territories" to keep your field operations running smoothly.		
					
					
	=================================
	OVERVIEW:
	========
		create operating hours
		create service territorie
		creates service resource
		create service territory member(JUNCTION OBJECT service resource ans service territory)
		
					
 ================================================================ XXXX ======================================== XXXX =========================================================
			
														(####  SKILL and PARTs requireds  ####)

							
			(#) Here Every thing revolves around the WO. So how do we create work order? Lets understand that??
				
				We create Work Order by "WORK TYPE"
					Work types are easy templates you can create for those common jobs your mobile workforce performs.
					for Ex: 
							The Ac service,  cable service provider 
							
			(#) Some job that field Technicians do almost everyday AND THE AGENTS HAVE TO CREATE workorder of them ALMOST EVERY HOUR.
			    TO make there life easy we can take use of WORK TYPE. 
			==> With which we  can add the approximate time and specify the parts and skills required to do a job so the right mobile resource is assigned the task at the right time.
				So Agents can quickly create work orders when cable install jobs come in.
			
			
		(###)WORK Type : basicly Work Type are used to create work order
			=========
			
			App Launcher ---> "Work Type" ---> NAME
											   ESTIMATED Duration
											   Duration Type(Hours, Min)
											   Auto-Create Service Appiontment --> i.e every time a WO created with this WT a new service appointment is created.
											   
											   Also every WT requires a specific SKILLS to complete.---IMAGIN YOU WANTE TO INSTALL A CABLE AND the person reaching out to you is a gardner. :D 
		XXXX########XXXX########XXXX########XXXX########XXXX########XXXX########XXXX########XXXX########XXXX########XXXX########XXXX########XXXX########XXXX########XXXX########XXXX		
			@@@@ CREATE SKILLS FROM SALESFORCE CLASSIC
			================================================
				- ADD TO WT related list
				- ADD TO SR related list
				- even we can assign the skills to work orders, and work order line items.
			
			
								
			sf classic ---> search "skills" ---> Skills --> new
		

		NOW
				Add SKILL TO THE WT ---------->> "Skill Required Related list"
				(Skill requirement is the junction object between skill and WO, WT, WO line item, job profile )
				
			
						
		AND
			
				Add "SKILL" to "Service Resource"----------> "skill" related list. 
				we create a SERVICE RESOURCE SKILL(junction between SR and SKILL)
				
				select SR ----> skill related list --> new ----> add skill, Skill Level, start date
		


NOW WE HAVE ADDED THE RIGHT skills TO THE SERVICE RESOURCE this time to add right PARTS need to finish the job. which they can get from INVENTORY lOCATION NEAR by them
also There can be many FIELD SERVICE INVENTORY LOCATION

	SO	
		(###)PRODUCT(PARTS) :- 
			============
							IDENTIFY ITEMS NEEDED
							Create INVENTORY Location
							CREATE PRODUCTS
							ASSOCIATE PRODUCTS WITH FIELD SERVICE LOCATION(INVENTORY LOCATION) @@@@---@@@--->> note: NOTE: "PRODUCT ITEMS"  junction object between "Location" and "Product" 
							
							update WT with Required PARTS needed
							
					======xxx-----xxxx====XXXX=====XXXXX
							
							
						(#)	Create : PRODUCT  ====> NAME, ACTIVE
						
						TO CREATE AN INVENTORY LOCATION:
						________________________________
						--------------------------------
						
						(#)	Cretae :search "locations" -----> pagelayout ---> Add "Inventory location" checkbox to layout --> SAVE
												now
												create "Locations record" ---> Name, LocationType(Van, Warehouse, Site), Inventory Location(check),Time Zone
					
				
		NOW WE HAVE CREATED "Inventory Location" THIS TIME TO ADD PRODUCTS TO it:--- by going into the PRODUCT ITEM related list.
					location related list --->  NEW product item
				
				NOTE: "PRODUCT ITEMs"  junction object between "Location" and "Product" 
				
			@@@ It's TIME TO SPECIFY "INVENTORY" FOR WHICH TERRITORIES 
			
					Since A Service territory can have multiple INVENTORY LOCATION So
					(#) Location record---------> "Service Territory Location" > Related list -->new
					
					
							
							
		(####)   WORK TYPE: =================>>>>> NOW UPDATE WORK TYPE related list "REQUIRED PRODUCTS" with above product
		
	

UFFF...... finally we have created a WT NOW LETS SEE HOW TO CREATE A WORK ORDER 
<#>	<#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#><#>

If  you are not from a service background you might be thinking what is a wo? when we create a WO? lets take a moment to understand, whenever a customer ask for a product or service organisation provide. AGENTS crate a workorder for that.
So A work order can be understand as specific customer request.
And
Having a work type to keep track of everything needed to complete the request.


WORKORDER : NEW
=========
			WorkType(Lookup)
			Status
			Priority
			Subject
			description
			work Type
			
			RELATED OBJECT
			===============
					products consumed  -- Products consumed are products that were used to COMPLETE a work order or work order line item.
					Products Required --  

Work Order Line Item: (Sub Task)  i.e they function same as WO but they are associated with a parent WO.
=====================

			WO(Lookup) PARENT Task
			work Type (sub task work type)

			RELATED OBJECT
			===============
					products consumed
					Products Required
					
--------------------------<@><@><@><@><@><@><@><@><@>--------@><@><@><@><@><@><@>----------<@><@><@><@><@><@><@><@>	--------<@><@><@><@><@><@><@><@><@>--------------------------
					
			NOW WE HAVE ALL THE DETAILS of task needto be done by our TECHNICIANS
			Let's ASSIGN it to SERVICE RESOURCE
			
		Before that we have to crate a WO SERVICE Appointment
			
			So go to WO related list 
			and you will find a SERVICE APPOINTMENT IS ALRADY CREATED WITH THE DETAILS this is because ....	
			
			NOW
			
			Go to "SERVICE APPOINTMENT" related list ---> NEW "ASSIGNED RESOURCE"  ---> assing it to a SERVICE RESOURCE(lookup USER)
			
	ONCE APPOINTMENT IS ASSIGNED TO A SERVICE RESOURCE
	=====================================================
			we can update the APPOINTMENT STATUS
								Status = Schedule
								Scheduled StartDate   --- need to be between EARLIEST START PERMITTED and DUE DATE
								Scheduled EndDate
								
	
NOW SERVICE RESOURCE IS GOOD TO GO ---->>>> once she will finish she will update the SERVICE APPOINTMENT status.


Similarly!!! assign WO LineItem to a servicer resouce... :)

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
REMEMBER :- updating "service appointment" STATUS doesn't update WO or WO Line Item status.
			So once work is done have to manually update the status
			

WE ALSO KNOW To COMPLETE A JOB A TECHNITION MAY HAVE UTILIZED PRODUCTS/Items, ALSO VERY NECESSORY TO KEEP TRACK OF ALL OF THIS.
So once a SERVICE APPOINTMENT IS COMPLETED i.e Wo OR WO LINE ITEM is completed to .... it's best to add detail to PRODUCT COMSUME related list.

				PRODUCT CONSUME:- junction object between WO and PRODUCT Item
																				Select Product Item(Lookup)... that got conumed
																				Quantity
																				
		What’s really cool is that when a consumed product is tracked... WHAT I MEAN IS 
				whenever a product consume is created then ... it got track under "Product Item Transaction" related list of PRODUCT ITEM and quantity got sub from PRODUCTITEM too
		isn't it great?

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

			Ufff a lot of work ....Right!!!... But u know this is not done yet. :) Nothing is more satisfying than a job well done and a satisfied customer.
			Now lwt's get to know how our custome feels about the service...
				BY
				Create a service report template for your customers with details about how your mobile workers solved their issues for work orders, work order line items, and service appointments and email them directly to the customer.
		
		HOW TO CREATE A SERCVE REPORT TEMPLATE?
		======================================
		
			Setup ---> Service Report Template ----> NEW and customize it
			
		(##) we can "CREARE A SERVICE REPORT" from the QUICK ACTION on WO  ----> "Create Service Resource"
				AND
				The service report is saved in the Service Reports related list on the work order.

	NOW WE HAVE FAMILIER WITH THE PLAYERS INVOLVE IN FSL. 
	
	
	EXAMPLE:
			The company started out with a few installers and an office manager......who managed installer’s tasks along with everything else. Then This Company hired more installers and a dispatcher. But the company is growing fast, and it’s too much for the dispatcher to handle using the current tools. Installers are ending up at the wrong place or they’re arriving at the wrong time. Sometimes, they’re at the right place at the right time but don’t have the tools they need. And customers are getting frustrated.
	
			Our company needs better tools to coordinate its expanding field service team. Field Service Lightning and its managed package are just what Our company needs to solve those problems. With it, the dispatcher can manage everything from a single console, where they can create and optimize schedules and resources.

Let’s see how.

user NAME:
			singh22bhagwan@resourceful-fox-hu883j.com
			Da$tan22
			
			
					
			
	Install and set up the Field Service Lightning managed package.
	Create a service territory.
	Create a service resource and a dispatcher.
	
	- The managed package powers up your field service team with some great new features.
		(+) Powerful scheduling features enable dispatchers to see appointment lists, scheduling actions, a resource availability chart, and an interactive map in one place in the dispatcher console.
		
		
			
			
		INSTALATION SETPS: It's time to install the goodness of the Lightning Field Service Managed package right into our ORG 
		===================
					
			(##) Step1:		open Incognito window -----Then ----->> https://fsl.secure.force.com/install
			
			(##) Step2:		after installing we got two application 
							=========================================
								"Field Service"  		--------- For Dispatcher [lets dispatchers do what they do best: view and manage an airtight service schedule!]
								"Field Service Admin"	 -------- For ADMIN [customize the managed package, manage scheduling and optimization, and use the dispatcher console.]
							
			(##) step3:  FSL PERMISSION SET : Enable permission sets that determine the access for EACH OF COMMON FS players(6 players)
				
							FSL app Admin ---> Field Service Settings ---> Permission set ----> Get Started ---> Permission Set -------> Click "Create Permission" for all 6 --> SAVE
							
			
			(##) Stap4: Assign yourself FSL ADMIN Permission
						Setup ----> Permission set ---> "FSL Admin Permissions" ---> Manage Assignment ---> Add Assignments---> Select Yourself
						
						
						
			(##) Step 5: Build your Team
						 (##) Create Service Territory
							===============================
							 Like technicians,  dispatchers are also assigned to service territories. When they’re working in their dispatcher console, they see only the territories that they manage.
							 
						 
						FSL app Admin ---> Field Service Settings ---> Go To Guided Setup ----> Click "Create Service Territories" ---> Enter Name "Los Angeles"
																			OR
																		Service Territories tab
																		
						
				NOW
					SET PERMISSION FOR SR/ CREATE A SR
					=====================
					Lets create a SR(James) for the new territory. So as a dispatcher we can manage James’s appointment assignments from the dispatcher console. 
					
					CREATE A USER
						Role	:  Instalation and Repair Service
						Licence	:	SALESFORCE
						Knowledge User
						Service Cloud User
						Deselect- Generate new password and notify user immediately
						
						[[... JamesSRBharat@gmail.com ...]
						
				(##) SET SR territory and PERMISSION from FSL Admin
					 --------------------------------
						
				FSL app Admin ---> Field Service Settings ---> Go To Guided Setup ---->  "Create Service Resources" ---> New service resource--> select USER and TERRITORY
																														 Give FSL scheduling and FSL Mobile Licence/permission
																														 
											
							ALRIGHT...
							
						James is all set up to start receiving work.
						
			
				(##) LETS ASSIGN OURSELF AS ..... Dispatcher of Los Angeles SERVICE Territory. So that we can start assigning work to James
				
			 FSL app Admin ---> Field Service Settings ---> Go To Guided Setup ----> "Create Dispatchers and Agents"
			 
			 THEN 
		   ========
			 
			Click  "Add" ---> select USER for "Assign Service Territories to"   ----> THEN -----> Select SERVICE TERRITORY "Los Angeles" ---> Click Assign Service Territories

======================================================================================================================================================================================

Customers are the beginning and end of the field service journey. The journey starts with a customer request and ends with a satisfied customer. But what happens along the way? That’s where Field Service Lightning shines.

Dispatcher job:
---------------
	Monitor service appointments in the assigned service area.
	Reschedule or cancel service appointments.
	Reassign service appointments to nearby service resources when the situation changes.
	Optimize the schedule based on worker skills, location, availability, and job priority.
	Keep service resources busy by managing their schedules.
	Coordinate resources, back office, and warehouse services.
	Dispatch service appointments to third-party contractors and crews and track them to completion.


			
 dispatcher console includes an appointment list, easy-to-reach scheduling actions, a dynamic Gantt chart, and customise
	The time horizon
	The dates displayed
	Gantt and map display preferences
	Color schemes
	Data filters 
	
	

Create your custome color palate for the GANTT


(#) From the list of appointments we can select un-scheduled appointments and then schedule them by the GANTT they got  automatically scheduled to a service resource with the correct skills and availability.

(#) If you schedule an appointment using the Schedule or Candidates actions, you won’t see any rules violations. But if you do manual scheduling, like dragging an appointment into a blank space on the Gantt, they can happen. Not to worry—they’re easy to fix.


(#) Create dreaw polygon teritorry EDIT the DISPATCHER PERMISSION Set
https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=pfs_map_polygons_enable.htm&type=5

we can create our own polygon service territory and give our name also. Or Service territory borders can be imported in KML (Keyhole Markup Language) instead of being drawn.



(#) We can see appintments according to differnent time zones.
set time zone based on user or territory 

FSL admin app ----> field service setting --> Dispatcher console UI ---> Gantt Configuration----> CHANGE "GANTT CHART TIMEZONE" to ---> Territory timeZone ---> SAVE
i.e see your Los Angeles appointments in Pacific time and her Denver appointments in mountain time.



(#) Add/Remove fields from the dispatcher example fields that comes in Appointments list,In a tooltip, in filters etc.
EDIT  OBJECT and then edit FIELD SET 
`we can edit SR and WO fields

(#) enable "DRIP-FEED" scheduling. When drip-feeding is enabled, service resources don’t receive their new appointment until they complete their current one.
	admin app --> field service setting---> Dispatcher --> Enable Drip Feed Dispatching
	

(#) diapatcher can create it's own custom filters.
	before thet ADMIN must enable it from ADMIN App ----> Dispatcher UI ---> Enable Custom Filters
	
	Now dispatcher can create there appointments filter feom the diapatcher console.
	
(#) to show different icon on the service appointments 
	edit PAGE LAYOUT OF "FSL Service Appointment Layout" ---> add GANT ICON --->save
	then
	ADD images from the GANTT service appointments
	

(#) 	WE CAN CREATE THEN Apex classes/ Visualforce  for CUSTOM ACTIONS FROM https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.220.0.field_service_dev.meta/field_service_dev/fsl_dev_code_samples_dispatcher.htm
		
	give user permission to use this apex classes.	
		setup ---> custom permission --> SELECT ONE and add "Permission to use <clsss name>" ---> save and then assign to the user
		
		then Add action to the dispatcher console
		------------------------------------
			Admin app --> Dispatcher console UI ---> Custom Action --->
